Create a pseudocode for the activity 
where a company decides to give a 7% bonus to employees 
if their years of service are more than 3 years. 
The pseudocode will accept user input for salary and years of service 
and then calculate and print the net bonus amount.

BEGIN
    PROMPT "Enter your salary: "
    READ salary

    PROMPT "Enter your years of service: "
    READ years_of_service

    IF years_of_service > 3 THEN
        SET bonus = salary * 0.07
    ELSE
        SET bonus = 0

    PRINT "Your bonus amount is: ", bonus
END
